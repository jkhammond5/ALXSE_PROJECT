I am a learner of the ALX FrontEnd Development program and I want to revamp my GitHub Profile to make it stand out from the crowd in my job search. This is why I started with software engineering, what I am passionate about and what inspires me: my desire to learn about so many things, and my desire to work collaboratively. My aim is to improve my skills in web development and to improvise with what I've learnt to make intelligent iterations in my work, and thatâ€™s why I would like to work on building interactive apps for schools and businesses, and other organisations.Please prepare a template I can use, which revamps all the sections of the GitHub profile. Enrich this template with HTML markups and compelling format and make it professional. After finishing, please ask me how you can help me making this template moreÂ personalized.
